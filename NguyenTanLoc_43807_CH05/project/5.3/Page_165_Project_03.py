Problem:Modify the sentence-generator program of Case Study 5.3 so that it inputs its
vocabulary from a set of text files at startup. The filenames are nouns.txt, verbs.
txt, articles.txt, and prepositions.txt. (Hint: Define a single new function,
getWords. This function should expect a filename as an argument. The function
should open an input file with this name, define a temporary list, read words
from the file, and add them to the list. The function should then convert the list
to a tuple and return this tuple. Call the function with an actual filename to initialize each of the four variables for the vocabulary.)
Solution:

    ....
