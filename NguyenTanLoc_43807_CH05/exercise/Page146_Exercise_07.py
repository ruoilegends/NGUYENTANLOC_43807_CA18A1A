Problem:
 Describe the costs and benefits of aliasing, and explain how it can be avoided.
Solution:
• Alias refers to the other name of the variable.
• The numbers and strings cannot be modified. That's the reason aliasing doesn't affect on strings and numbers.
• The elements in the list can be modified. So the lists are mutable.
• If aliasing is done for the lists then if the change is done for the list it will be affected to the aliasing list also.
