Problem:
 What roles do the parameters and the return statement play in a function definition?
Solution:
-Parameter refers to the name of the arguments that is found in the function definition.
-Parameter receives a copy of arguments value. The number of parameters in the function call should be same as the number
 of parameters in the function definition otherwise it throws an error.
-It is not mandatory that every function should have parameter. There can be function without parameter also.
Mainly the parameters are used to pass the values of the variables from function to another.
-"Return" is the keyword which is used while exiting the function. The values that are evaluated in the function can be
passed back to the caller function using return statement. During execution if it encounters "roturn" statement the control
is passed back to the caller function.
-In function definition we will get to know the number of parameters passed and whether the function is returning any value or not.
