Problem:
 What is a mutator method? Explain why mutator methods usually return the
value None.
Solution:
Mutator methods are the methods that are used to modify the internal elements of the mutable objects. The Mutable object means which can be modified.
For example consider the "list" which is the mutable object.
The "list" is having its own methods such as insert, append, pop which are used to modify the elements in the list. These methods are the mutator methods.
