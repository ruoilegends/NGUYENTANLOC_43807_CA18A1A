Problem:
 What is the purpose of a main function?
Solution:
The execution of the program starts from the main function. It serves as entry point to start the execution. The main function
 in turn calls the other functions which are defined inside the main. The main function usually used to accept the user
 inputs and then pass it to the other functions while calling it.
