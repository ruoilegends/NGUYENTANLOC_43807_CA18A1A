Problem:
 Explain how an algorithm solves a general class of problems and how a function
definition can support this property of an algorithm.
Solution:
How algorithms solve the general case of problems?
 • The algorithm is a well-defined sequence of steps to be followed to solve a problem.
 • It is considered as a blueprint for a program.
 • Let us consider an algorithm to find greater among 3 and 5.
 1. Start
 2. Read the first number
 3. Read the second number
 4. If the first number is grsater than the second number then the first number is greatest
 5. else the second number is the greatest
 6. Stop
 • Examine the above algorithm, though the algorithm is intended to find the largest among numbers 3 and 5 it is written as
 a generalized algorithm that can find the largest among any two given numbers.
 • The individual problems that make up a class of problems are known as problem instances.
 • In the above algorithm, the problems instances are two numbers between which the greatest should be found.
 • The algorithm that we write should be capable of solving different problem instances but not a few among them.
 • This is how the algorithms solve a general class of problems
