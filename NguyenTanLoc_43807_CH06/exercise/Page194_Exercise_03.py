Problem:
 What is the lifetime of a variable? Give an example.
Solution:
The lifetime of a variable is the time during which the variable stays in memory and is therefore accessible during
program execution. The variables that are local to a method are created the moment the method is activated
(exactly as formal parameters) and are destroyed when the activation of the method terminates.
