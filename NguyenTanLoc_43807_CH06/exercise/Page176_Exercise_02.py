Problem:
 Describe the processes of top-down design and stepwise refinement. Where does
the design start, and how does it proceed?
Solution:
The top-down approach and stepwise refinement
 • There are different approaches to solve a problem like a bottom-up approach, a greedy approach, and many more.
 • The most popular strategy used to solve the problem of any level of complexity is the top-down approach.
 • In this approach, the central idea of the problem is verified and then the complex problem is divided into many sub-problems.
 • The sub-problems are isolated from the main problem and are provided with a specific task that it should perform.
 • Finally, all the results from the isolated functions are joined together to form a resultant final output.
 • The process of decomposing a problem into many sub-problems is known as problem decomposition.
 • The isolated sub-problems can be again divided into two or more lower-level problems until a breakdown that is specific
 and can be written in a smaller number of lines of code with proper judgment without any ambiguity is obtained.
 • The process of breaking down the isolated sub-problems into many meaningful lower-level problems is known as stepwise refinement.
