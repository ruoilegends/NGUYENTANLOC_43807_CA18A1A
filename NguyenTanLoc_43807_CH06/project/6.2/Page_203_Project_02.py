Problem:
Convert Newtonâ€™s method for approximating square roots in Project 1 to a recursive function named newton. (Hint: The estimate of the square root should be
passed as a second argument to the function.)
Solution:


    ....
"""
import math

# Initialize the tolerance
TOLERANCE = 0.000001

    """Returns the square root of x."""
    # Compute the difference and test for the base case
    difference = abs(x - estimate ** 2)
    if difference <= TOLERANCE:
        return estimate
    else:
        # Recurse after improving the estimate
        return newton (x, (estimate + x / estimate) / 2)
