Problem: How does a Python programmer round a float value to the nearest int value?
Solution: • To round a float value to the nearest int value, round() function is used which gives the rounded off value of float value.
• If the value after decimal point is greater than 0.5, then round() function returns the ceil value of the float value
 otherwise it will return the floor value of the float value.
