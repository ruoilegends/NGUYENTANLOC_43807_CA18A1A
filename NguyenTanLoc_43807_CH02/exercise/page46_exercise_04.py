Problem: What happens when the print function prints a string literal with embedded
newline characters?
Solution:
 To output a paragraph of text that contains several lines, you could use a separate print function call for each line.
 However, it is more convenient to enclose the entire string literal, line breaks and all, within three consecutive quotation marks
(either single or double) for printing
