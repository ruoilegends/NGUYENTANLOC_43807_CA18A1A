Problem:Explain the differences between the data types int and float
Solution:
int: We are used for integer. We have range from -32768 to 32768 (in Java: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647).
True their size is 2 bytes in C++ (4 bytes in Java).
float: they are used for the decimal type integer.
Their range is Â±3.40282347E+38F in Java (and similar in C++). Their size is 4 bytes in Java (4 bytes in C++).
