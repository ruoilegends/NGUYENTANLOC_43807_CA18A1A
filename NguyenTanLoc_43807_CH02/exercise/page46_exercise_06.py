Problem: List two of the purposes of program documentation
Solution:
In a program, good documentation can be as important as executable code. Ideally, program code is self-documenting,
so a human reader can instantly understand it. However,
a program is often read by people who are not its authors, and even the authors might find
their own code inscrutable after months of not seeing it. The trick is to avoid documenting
code that has an obvious meaning, but to aid the poor reader when the code alone might
not provide sufficient understanding
