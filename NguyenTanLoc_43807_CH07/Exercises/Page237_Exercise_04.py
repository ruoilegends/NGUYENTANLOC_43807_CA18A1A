Problem:
 Describe how a row-major traversal visits every position in a two-dimensional grid.
Solution:
Sampling devices measure discrete color values at distinct points on a two-dimensional grid. These values
are pixels, which were introduced earlier in this chapter. In theory, the more pixels that are sampled,
the more continuous and realistic the resulting image will appear. In practice, however, the human eye
cannot discern objects that are closer together than 0.1 mm, so a sampling of 10 pixels per linear
millimeter (250 pixels per inch and 62,500 pixels per square inch) would be plenty accurate.
Thus, a 3-inch by 5-inch image would need which is approximately one megapixel. For most purposes,
however, you can settle for a much lower sampling size and, thus, fewer pixels per square inch.
