Problem:
 Explain the importance of the interface of a class of objects.
Solution:
Importance of Interface of a particular class
• The set of methods that a class contains is called its interface.
• A programmer can perform various actions on a method only when he is aware of the methods of the class that the object belongs to.
• Thus, the interface contains all the information that is required to work with objects of a particular class.
• This interface can be best understood as the handbook you get for every new product that you buy. When you buy a new product,
  you are provided with a handbook that contains all the capabilities of your product. Though you are unfamiliar with
  that product you can get familiarized with user selves by reading that handbook.
 • In the same way, an interface contains method headers and documentation about the method's arguments, values returned, and changes to the state of associated objects.
 • You can view the interface of an entire class or entire method using the help command.
 • If you pass the class as an argument for the help function then the interface of the class will be returned as output
   and if you pass the method name as an argument, the interface of the method will be returned as output.
 • Help function is called as follows help(Class_Name) or help(Class_Name.Method_Name)
 • The dir(Class_Name) function returns the names of all the method of the class that is passed as an argument in the form of a list.
