Problem:
The edge-detection function described in this chapter returns a black-and-white
image. Think of a similar way to transform color values so that the new image is still
in its original colors but the outlines within it are merely sharpened. Then, define a
function named sharpen that performs this operation. The function should expect
an image and two integers as arguments. One integer should represent the degree
to which the image should be sharpened. The other integer should represent the
threshold used to detect edges. (Hint: A pixel can be darkened by making its RGB
values smaller.)
Solution:
