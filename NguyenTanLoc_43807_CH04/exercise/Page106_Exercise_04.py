Problem:
    Assume that the variable myString refers to a string, and the variable
reversedString refers to an empty string. Write a loop that adds the characters
from myString to reversedString in reverse order.
Solution:
• The variable myString refers to a string "Hello World!".
• Define another variable reversedString contains an empty string "".
• Using loop for the range of the length of the myString take each character by using negative subscript notation to add in the string reversedString in reverse order.
• Print the variable reversedString and check if it contains the characters of myString in reverse order.
