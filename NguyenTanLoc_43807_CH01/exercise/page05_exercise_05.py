Problem: In what sense is a laptop computer a general-purpose problem-solving machine?
Solution:  Maybe you watched a digital movie on your laptop after preparing a snack in the microwave.
           Chances are today you'll be calling, sending or receiving a text message, taking a photo,
           or referencing your favorite social network on your laptop.
           You and your friends have a lot of subjects that can use laptops to do some important studies that are not possible in high school or college.
