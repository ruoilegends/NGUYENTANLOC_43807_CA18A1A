Problem: What is the difference between a terminal-based interface and a graphical user interface?
Solution: Character user interface, also known as command-line user interface or non graphical user interface,
refers to the use of text commands, managed by a command-line interpreter,
in order to communicate with a computer program.
Typically software developers and system administrators rely on command-line interfaces to configure machines,
manage computer files, and access program features that are otherwise unavailable on a graphical user interface.
          Character user interfaces support automation and scripting and tend to provide greater granular control and a higher level of functionality than graphical user interfaces.
While the character user interface was the primary method of operating computers through the 1980s,
most modern electronic devices are equipped with intuitive graphical user interfaces and the average user will rarely if ever have cause to access a computer terminal.
