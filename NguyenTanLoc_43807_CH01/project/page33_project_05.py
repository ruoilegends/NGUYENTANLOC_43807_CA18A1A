Problem: Modify the program of Project 4 to compute the area of a triangle. Issue the
appropriate prompts for the triangle’s base and height, and change the names of
the variables appropriately. Then, use the formula .5 * base * height to compute the area. Test the program from an IDLE window.
Solution:

"""
base=int(input("Enter with base:"))
height=int(input("Enter with height:"))
area=5*base*height
print("The area is",area,"square units")
