Problem: Write and test a program that computes the area of a circle. This program should
request a number representing a radius as input from the user. It should use the formula
3.14 * radius ** 2 to compute the area and then output this result suitably labeled.
Solution:

"""
radius= int(input(" BANKINH:"))
CT=3.14*radius**2
print("ket qua la :",CT)
