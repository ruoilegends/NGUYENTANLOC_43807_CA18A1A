Problem: Open an IDLE window, and enter the program from Figure 1-7 that computes
the area of a rectangle. Load the program into the shell by pressing the F5 key,
and correct any errors that occur. Test the program with different inputs by

Width=int(input("Enter with Width:"))
height=int(input("Enter with height:"))
area=Width*height
print("The area is",area,"square units")
